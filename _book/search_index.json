We will study the discrete distributions: Bernoulli, binomial, geometric and Poisson. We will also study the continuous distributions: uniform, exponential, normal. 5.1 The Bernoulli distribution 5.2 The binomial distribution 5.3 The geometric distribution 5.4 The Poisson distribution 5.5 The uniform distribution 5.6 The exponential distribution 5.7 The normal distribution 5.8 QQ plots "]
