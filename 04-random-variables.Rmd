# Random variables {#rvs}

**Example**. We return to the space shuttle example.  

Consider what happens to the O-rings on a particular test flight, at a particular temperature.  A given O-ring either is damaged (shows signs of thermal distress) or it is not damaged. Let $D$ denote the event that an O-ring is damaged and $\bar{D}$ the event that it is not damaged. If we consider all 6 O-rings, there are many possible outcomes in the sample space, $2^6=64$, in fact:
\[ S= \{DDDDDD\}, \{DDDDD\bar{D}\}, \ldots, \{D\bar{D}\bar{D}\bar{D}\bar{D}\bar{D}\}, 
\{\bar{D}\bar{D}\bar{D}\bar{D}\bar{D}\bar{D}\}. \]
Suppose that we are not interested in which particular O-rings were damaged, just the total number $N$ of damaged O-rings. The possible values for $N$ are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. 

Each outcome in $S$ gives a value for $N$ in \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\}:

$\{DDDDDD\}$ gives $N=6$, 

$\{DDDDD\bar{D}\}$ gives $N=5$, 

$\{DDDD\bar{D}D\}$ gives $N=5$, 

$\vdots$ 

$\{\bar{D}\bar{D}\bar{D}\bar{D}\bar{D}\bar{D}\}$ gives $N=0$.

By defining $N$ to be the total number of damaged O-rings, we have moved from considering outcomes to considering a variable with a numerical value.  $N$ is a real-valued function on the sample space $S$, that is, $N$ maps each outcome in $S$ to a real number.  $N$ is a rule that assigns a real number to every outcome $s$ in $S$.  Since the outcomes in $S$ are random the variable $N$ is also random, and we can assign probabilities to its possible values, that is, $P(N=0), P(N=1)$ and so on.

$N$ is a **random variable**.  In fact, if we assume that O-rings are damaged independently of each other and each O-ring has the same probability $p$ of being damaged, $N$ is a random variable with a special name.  It is a binomial random variable with parameters 6 and $p$.  We will consider binomial random variables in more detail in Section \@ref(binomial).

**Notation**. We denote random variables by upper case letters, for example, $N, X, Y, Z$.  Once we have observed the value of a random variable it is no longer random: it is equal to a particular value.  To make this clear we denote sample values of r.v.s. by lower case letters, for example, $n, x, y, z$ and write $N=n, X=x$ and so on.  Thus, $P(X=x)$ is the probability that the random variable $X$ has the value $x$.

## Discrete random variables {#discrete}

**Definition**. A discrete random variable is a random variable that can take only a finite, or countably infinite, number of values.  

An example of a countably infinite set of values is \{0,1,2,3,\ldots\}. The random variable $N$ in the space shuttle example takes a finite number of values: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. Therefore $N$ is a discrete random variable.

**Definition**. Let $X$ be a discrete random variable.  The **probability mass function (p.m.f.)** $p_X(x)$, or simply $p(x)$, of $X$ is
\[ p_X(x) = P(X=x), \qquad \mbox{for $x$ in the support of $X$}.  \]

The p.m.f. of $X$ tells us the probability with which $X$ takes any particular value $x$.  The **support** of $X$ is the set of values that it is possible for $X$ to take.  It is very important to write this down every time you write down a p.m.f.. A discrete random variable is completely specified by its probability mass function.

**Properties of p.m.f.s**

Let $X$ take values $x_1, x_2,\ldots.$  Then

1. $p_X(x_i) \geq 0$, for all $i$,
2. $\displaystyle\sum_i p_X(x_i) = 1$.

Note: 1. is true because the $p_X(x_i)$s are probabilities; 2. is true because summing over the $x_i$s is equivalent to summing over the sample space of outcomes.

**Definition**. The cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of a random variable $X$ is
\[ F_X(x) = P(X \leq x), \qquad \mbox{for} -\infty < x < \infty. \]

**Relationship between the c.d.f. and p.m.f. of a discrete random variable**. For a discrete random variable:
\[ F_X(x) = P(X \leq x) = \sum_{x_i \leq x} P(X = x_i). \]
Therefore, assuming for the moment that the random variable takes only integer values,
\[ P(X=x) = P(X \leq x) - P(X \leq x-1) = F_X(x) - F_X(x-1) \] 
for any integer $x$

## Continuous random variables {#continuous}

**Example**. We return to the Oxford birth times example. 

The top plot in Figure \@ref(fig:oxcontvar) shows a histogram of the 95 birth times.  The variable of interest in this example is a time.  Time is a continuous variable: in principle, the times in this dataset could take any positive real value, uncountably many values. In practice, these times have been recorded discretely, in units of 1/10 of an hour or 1/4 of an hour.

```{r echo=FALSE, oxcontvar, fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Top: histogram of the Oxford birth durations. Second from top: histogram of 1,000 values simulated from a distribution fitted to the data. Second from bottom: similarly for 10,000 simulated values. Bottom: p.d.f. of the distribution fitted to the Oxford birth times data.'}
include_cropped_graphics("images/ox_cont_var.png")
```

Suppose that we continue to collect data on birth duration from this hospital, and, as new observations arrive, we add them to the top histogram in Figure \@ref(fig:oxcontvar).  We imagine that the times are recorded continuously.  As the number of observations $n$ increases we decrease the bin width of the histogram. As $n$ increases to infinity the bin width shrinks to zero and the histogram tends to a smooth continuous curve.

This is shown in the bottom 3 plots in Figure \@ref(fig:oxcontvar).  The extra data are not real.  They are data I have simulated, using a computer, to have a distribution with a similar shape to the histogram of the real data.  

Let $T$ denote the time, in hours, that a woman arriving at the hospital takes to give birth. The smooth continuous curve at the bottom of Figure \@ref(fig:oxcontvar) is called the **probability density function (p.d.f.)** $f_T(t)$ of the random variable $T$. Since the total area of the rectangles in a histogram is equal to 1, the area  $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_T(t) \, \mathrm{d}t$ under the p.d.f. $f_T(t)$ is equal to 1.   

**Definition**.  A **probability density function (p.d.f.)** is a function $f_{X}(x)$, or simply $f(x)$, such that 

1. $f_X(x) \geq 0$, for $-\infty < x < \infty$;
2. $\displaystyle\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_X(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = 1$. 

Therefore, p.d.f.s are always non-negative and integrate to 1. The support of a continuous random variable is the set of values for which the p.d.f. is positive. Suppose that we wish to find $P(4 < T \leq 12)$.  To find the proportion of times between 4 and 12 using a histogram, we sum the areas of all bins between 4 and 12, that is, we find the area shaded in the histogram in Figure \@ref(fig:oxshady). To do this using the p.d.f. we do effectively the same thing: we find the area under the p.d.f. $f_T(t)$ between 4 and 12.  Since $f_T(t)$ is a smooth continuous curve, (that is, the bin widths are zero) we integrate $f_T(t)$ between 4 and 12.

```{r echo=FALSE, oxshady, fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Top: histogram of the Oxford birth durations. Bottom: p.d.f. of the distribution fitted to the Oxford birth duration data.'}
include_cropped_graphics("images/ox_shady.png")
```

Therefore
\[ P(4 < T \leq 12) = \displaystyle\int_4^{12} f_T(t) \,\mathrm{d}t = F_T(12)-F_T(4). \]

More generally,
\[ P(a < T \leq b) = \displaystyle\int_a^b f_T(t) \,\mathrm{d}t = F_T(b)-F_T(a). \]

**Definition**. A random variable $X$ is a **continuous random variable** if there exists a p.d.f. $f_X(x)$ such that 
$$
P(a < X \leq b) = \int_{a}^{b} f_X(x) \,\mathrm{d}x,
$$
for all $a$ and $b$ such that $a < b$.

Figure \@ref(fig:pdfshady) illustrates the properties of a p.d.f..

```{r echo=FALSE, pdfshady, fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Properties of a p.d.f.. The areas that correspond to the probability that a random variable takes a value in a given interval are shaded.'}
include_cropped_graphics("images/pdf_shady.png")
```

Notes

* It is very important to appreciate that $f_X(x)$ is **not** a probability: it does **not** give $P(X=x)$.  In fact $P(X=x)=0$: the probability that a continuous random variable $X$ takes the value $x$ is zero.
* Indeed, it is possible for a p.d.f. to be greater than 1.  Consider a continuous random variable $X$ with p.d.f.
\[ f_X(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 2\,(1-x) & \,0 \leq x \leq 1, \\ 0 & \,\mbox{otherwise}.\end{array}\right. \]
For this random variable $f_X(x)>1$ for any $x \in [0, 1/2)$ .
* Since $P(X=x)=0$ 
\[ P(a < X \leq b) = P(a \leq X \leq b) = P(a \leq X < b) = P(a < X < b). \]
* $f_X(x)$ is a probability **density**.  The probability that $X$ lies in a very small interval of length $\delta$ near $x$ is approximately $f_X(x) \delta$.  For the p.d.f. at the bottom of figure \@ref(fig:oxcontvar), $f_T(6) > f_T(12)$, indicating that a randomly chosen woman is more likely to spend approximately 6 hours giving birth than approximately 
12 hours.

**Relationship between the c.d.f. and p.d.f. of a continuous random variable**.  For a continuous random variable
\[ F_X(x) = P(X \leq x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f_X(u) \,\mathrm{d}u. \] 
Therefore,
\[ f_X(x) = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} F_X(x). \]

## Expectation

The expectation of a random variable is a measure of the location of its distribution.

### Expectation of a discrete random variable

**Example**. We return to the space shuttle example.  

Again we consider test flights conducted at a particular temperature, say 53$^\circ$F. Suppose that NASA are able to conduct a very large number $n$ of test flights at  53$^\circ$F, producing a sample $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ of numbers of damaged O-rings.

Let $n(x)$ be the number of test flights on which $x$ of the 6 O-rings were damaged. We can write the sample mean $\bar{x}$ of $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ as
\begin{eqnarray*}
\bar{x} &=& \frac{0 \times n(0) + 1 \times n(1) + \cdots + 6 \times n(6)}{n}, \\
&=& \sum_{x=0}^6 x\,\frac{n(x)}{n}.
\end{eqnarray*}
As the sample size $n$ increases to infinity, the sample proportion $n(x)/n$ tends to $P(X=x)$, for  $x=0,1,\ldots,6$.  Therefore, in the limit as $n \rightarrow \infty$, $\bar{x}$ tends to
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{x=0}^6 x\,P(X=x). 
(\#eq:shuttlemean)
\end{eqnarray}
This is known as the mean of the probability distribution of $X$.  It is a measure of the location of the distribution.

The quantity in equation \@ref(eq:shuttlemean) is the value of the sample mean $\bar{x}$ that we would expect to get from a very large sample. Therefore it is often called the **expectation** or **expected value** of the random variable $X$ and it is denoted $\mathrm{E}(X)$.

**Definition**. The **expectation** (or **expected value** or **mean**) $\mathrm{E}(X)$ of a discrete random variable $X$ is given by 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{E}(X) &=& \sum_x x\,P(X=x). 
(\#eq:discmean)
\end{eqnarray}
This is a weighted average of the values that $X$ can take, each value being weighted by $P(X=x)$.

Note:

* We often write $\mu$ or $\mu_X$ for $\mathrm{E}(X)$.
* Units:  the units of $\mathrm{E}(X)$ are the same as those of $X$. For example, if $X$ is measured in hours then $\mathrm{E}(X)$ is measured in hours.
* $\mathrm{E}(X)$ exists only if  $\sum_x |x|\,P(X=x) < \infty$. If the number of values $X$ can take is finite then $\mathrm{E}(X)$ will always exist.

### Expectation of a continuous random variable

We can define the expectation of a continuous random variable in a similar way to a discrete random variable, replacing summation with integration.

**Definition**.
The expectation $\mathrm{E}(X)$ of a continuous random variable $X$ is given by 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{E}(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x\,f_X(x) \,\mathrm{d}x. 
(\#eq:contmean)
\end{eqnarray}
Note:

* Like the discrete case, this is a weighted average of the values that $X$ can take, but now each value is weighted by the
p.d.f. $f_X(x)$.
* The range of integration in equation \@ref(eq:contmean) is over the whole real line but, in practice, integration will be over the range of possible values of $X$.
* $\mathrm{E}(X)$ exists only if  $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |x|\,f_X(x) \,\mathrm{d}x < \infty$.

### Properties of $\mathrm{E}(X)$

If $a$ and $b$ are constants then
\[ \mathrm{E}(a\,X+b) = a\,\mathrm{E}(X)+b. \]
This makes sense.  If we multiply all observations by $a$ their mean will also be multiplied by $a$. If we add $b$ to all observations their mean will be increased by $b$, that is, the distribution of $X$ shifts up by $b$.

* If $X \geq 0$ then $\mathrm{E}(X) \geq 0$.
* If $X$ is a constant $c$, that is, $P(X=c)=1$ then $\mathrm{E}(X)=c$.
* It can be shown that 
\[ \mathrm{E}(X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n) = \mathrm{E}(X_1) + \mathrm{E}(X_2) + \cdots + \mathrm{E}(X_n). \]


### The expectation of $g(X)$

Suppose that $Y=g(X)$ is a function of of $X$, such as $aX+b$, $X^2$ or $\log X$.  Then $Y$ is also a random variable.  If we find the p.m.f (if $Y$ is discrete) or p.d.f. (if $Y$ is continuous) of $Y$ then we can find the the expectation of $Y$ using equation \@ref(eq:discmean) or \@ref(eq:contmean) as appropriate.

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{E}(Y) = \mathrm{E}[g(X)] =
\begin{cases} 
\displaystyle\sum_x g(x)\,P(X=x) & \text{if } X \text{ is discrete}, \\
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(x)\,f_X(x) \,\mathrm{d}x & \text{if } X \text{ is continuous}.
\end{cases}
(\#eq:expfn)
\end{equation}

Note, it is usually the case that
\[ \mathrm{E}[g(X)] \neq g[\mathrm{E}(X)] \]
although there are exceptions.

## Variance

The variance of a random variable is a measure of the spread of its distribution.

### Variance of a discrete random variable

**Example**. We return the space shuttle example.

As before we let $n(x)$ be the number of test flights on which $x$ of the 6 O-rings were damaged.  We saw in Section \@ref(meanstdev) that a measure of the spread of a sample $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ is the sample variance $s_X^2$ which, in this example, can be written as

\begin{eqnarray*}
s_X^2 &=& \frac{1}{n-1}\,\left\{
(0-\bar{x})^2\,n(0)+(1-\bar{x})^2\,n(1)+\cdots+(6-\bar{x})^2\,n(6) \right\},
\\
      &=& \sum_{x=0}^6 (x-\bar{x})^2\,\frac{n(x)}{n-1}. 
\end{eqnarray*}
As the sample size $n$ increases to infinity, $\frac{n(x)}{n-1}$ tends to $P(X=x)$, for $x=0,1,\ldots,6$ and $\bar{x}$ tends to $\mu$=$\mathrm{E}(X)$.  

Therefore, as $n \rightarrow \infty$, $s_X^2$ tends to

\begin{equation}
\sum_{x=0}^6 (x-\mu)^2\,P(X=x). 
(\#eq:shuttlevar)
\end{equation}

This is known as the variance of the probability distribution of $X$.  It is a measure of the spread of the distribution. The quantity in equation \@ref(eq:shuttlevar) is the value of the sample variance $s_X^2$ that we would expect to get from a very large sample.

**Definition**. The variance $\mathrm{var}(X)$ of a discrete random variable $X$ with mean $\mathrm{E}(X)=\mu$ is given by

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{var}(X) = \sum_x\,(x-\mu)^2\,P(X=x). 
(\#eq:varidisc)
\end{equation}

This is a weighted average of the squared differences between the values that $X$ can take and its mean $\mu$, each value being weighted by $P(X=x)$.

Note:

* $\mathrm{var}(X)$ exists only if  $\mu$ exists and $\sum_x (x-\mu)^2\,P(X=x) < \infty$.  If the number of values $X$ can take is finite then $\mathrm{var}(X)$ will always exist.
* We often write $\sigma^2$ or $\sigma_X^2$ for $\mathrm{var}(X)$.

### Variance of a continuous random variable

We can define the variance of a continuous random variable in a similar way to a discrete random variable, replacing summation with integration.

**Definition**. The variance $\mathrm{var}(X)$ of a continuous random variable $X$ with mean $\mathrm{E}(X)=\mu$ is given by

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{var}(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (x-\mu)^2 f_X(x) \,\mathrm{d}x. 
(\#eq:varicont)
\end{equation}

Note: $\mathrm{var}(X)$ exists only if $\mu$ exists and $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (x-\mu)^2\,f_X(x) \,\mathrm{d}x < \infty$.

### Variance and standard deviation

**Definition**. Let $X$ be a random variable with $\mathrm{E}(X)=\mu$.  The variance $\mathrm{var}(X)$ is given by
\[ \mathrm{var}(X) = \mathrm{E}\left[(X-\mu)^2\right]. \]
This follows from equations \@ref(eq:varidisc) and \@ref(eq:varicont) and the expression in equation \@ref(eq:expfn) for the expectation of a function $g(X)$ of a random variable $X$.

There is an alternative way to calculate $\mathrm{var}(X)$:
\[ \mathrm{var}(X) = \mathrm{E}\left(X^2\right) - [\mathrm{E}(X)]^2. \]

**Exercise**. Prove this.

**Definition**. The standard deviation sd$(X)$ of $X$ is given by sd($X$)=$+\sqrt{\mathrm{var}(X)}$. 

Notes on $\mathrm{var}(X)$:

* $\mathrm{var}(X) \geq 0$.  A variance cannot be negative.  
* Units:  the units of $\mathrm{var}(X)$ are the square of those of $X$. For example, if $X$ is measured in hours then $\mathrm{var}(X)$ is measured in hours$^2$ (and sd($X$) is measured in hours).

### Properties of $\mathrm{var}(X)$

* If $a$ and $b$ are constants then
\[ \mathrm{var}(a\,X+b) = a^2\,\mathrm{var}(X). \]
This makes sense.  If we multiply all observations by $a$ their variance, which is measured square units, will be multiplied by $a^2$. If we add $b$ to all observations their variance will be unchanged because the distribution simply shifts up by $b$ and its spread is unaffected.
* If $X$ is a constant $c$, that is, $P(X=c)=1$ then $\mathrm{var}(X)=0$: the distribution of $X$ has zero spread.
* It can also be shown that **if the random variables $X_1, X_2, \ldots X_n$ are independent** then

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{var}(X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n) = \mathrm{var}(X_1) + \mathrm{var}(X_2) + \cdots + \mathrm{var}(X_n). 
(\#eq:varsum)
\end{equation}

**Note**. Independence is sufficient for this result to hold but it is not necessary.  Taking $n=2$ as an example, in generality we have 
\[ \mathrm{var}(X_1 + X_2) = \mathrm{var}(X_1) + \mathrm{var}(X_2) + 2\,\mathrm{cov}(X_1,X_2), \]
where $\mathrm{cov}(X_1,X_2)$ is the **covariance** between the random variables $X_1$ and $X_2$.  Covariance is a measure of the strength of **linear** association. If $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent (have no association of any kind) then $\mathrm{cov}(X_1,X_2)=0$, because they have no linear association. However, it is possible for $X_1$ and $X_2$ to be dependent but $\mathrm{cov}(X_1,X_2)=0$, because, although they have some kind of association, they have no **linear** association. Thus, independence is a stronger requirement than zero covariance.

Returing to general $n$ we have
\[ \mathrm{var}(X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n) = \mathrm{var}(X_1) + \mathrm{var}(X_2) + \cdots + \mathrm{var}(X_n) + 2 \mathop{\sum\sum}_{i < j} \mathrm{cov}(X_i,X_j). \]
If $\mathrm{cov}(X_i,X_j)=0$ for all $i < j$ then equation \@ref(eq:varsum) holds. We will study covariance, and its standardised form **correlation**, in Section \@ref(correlationchapter).

## Other measures of location {#locations}

### The median of a random variable

Recall that the sample median of a set of observations is the middle observation when the observations are arranged in order of size. We define the median of a random variable $X$ as the value, median($X$), such that

\[ P(X < \mathrm{median}(X)) \leq \frac12 \leq P(X \leq \mathrm{median}(X)). \]

In other words, $\mathrm{median}(X)$ is the value where a plot of the c.d.f. $F_X(x)=P(X \leq x)$ crosses $1/2$.

For a continuous random variable $X$ we have
\[  F_X(\mathrm{median}(X)) = P(X \leq \mathrm{median}(X)) =\frac12. \]
and the median will divide the distribution into two parts, each with probability 1/2:
\[ P(X < \mathrm{median}(X)) = P(X > \mathrm{median}(X)) = \frac12. \]

This will not necessarily hold for a discrete distribution.  For example, suppose that 
\[ P(X=0)=\frac16, \qquad  P(X=1)=\frac12, \qquad P(X=2)=\frac13. \]  

Then
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_X(x) = P(X \leq x) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
0 & \mbox{for } x <0, \\
\frac16 & \mbox{for } 0 \leq x < 1, \\
\frac23 & \mbox{for } 1 \leq x < 2, \\
1 & \mbox{for } x \geq 2, 
\end{array}\right.
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore, $\mathrm{median}(X) = 1$. However, $P(X<1)=\frac16$ and $P(X>1)=\frac13$.

### The mode of a random variable

Recall that the sample mode of categorical or discrete data is the value (or values) which occurs most often.  We define the mode, mode($X$), of a random variable as follows.

For a discrete random variable $X$, the mode is the value which has the highest probability of occurring: $P(X=\mathrm{mode}(X))$ will be larger than for any other value $X$ can have. In other words, $\mathrm{mode}(X)$ is the value at which the p.m.f. is maximised.

For a continuous random variable $X$, the mode is the value at which the p.d.f. is maximised.  **If the maximum occurs at a turning point of $f_X(x)$** then it can be found by solving the equation
\[ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} f_X(x)  = 0, \]
and checking that you have indeed found a maximum.

## Quantiles

To keep things simple we consider a **continuous** random variable $X$.  The $100p\%$ quantile of $X$ is defined to be the value $x_p$ such that 
\[ F_X(x_p)=P(X \leq x_p) = p. \]
Thus, $x_{1/4}$ is the lower quartile of $X$, $x_{1/2}$ is the median of $X$ and $x_{3/4}$ is the upper quartile of $X$.  The inter-quartile range is $x_{3/4}-x_{1/4}$.
